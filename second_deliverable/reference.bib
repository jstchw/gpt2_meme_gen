abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are a promising tool for solving the problem of pattern recognition. Most well-known convolutional neural networks implementations require a significant amount of memory to store weights in the process of learning and working. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture in which the neural network is divided into hardware and software parts to increase performance and reduce the cost of implementation resources. We also propose to use the residue number system (RNS) in the hardware part to implement the convolutional layer of the neural network. Software simulations using Matlab 2018b showed that convolutional neural network with a minimum number of layers can be quickly and successfully trained. The hardware implementation of the convolution layer shows that the use of RNS allows to reduce the hardware costs on 7.86%–37.78% compared to the two’s complement implementation. The use of the proposed heterogeneous implementation reduces the average time of image recognition by 41.17%.}

    abstract = "{Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",
